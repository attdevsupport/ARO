Requirements:
- NSIS  (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page)
- Intec (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Inetc_plug-in)
- Launch4j (http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/)

1)  Generate the wrapper with launch4j and the laun4j_aro.xml configuration file
    This will create the aro.exe file.
2)  Build the installer with makensis by running "makensis install.nsis" from this
    directory.
    This will package the wrapper and all the required files in a setup.exe file.
